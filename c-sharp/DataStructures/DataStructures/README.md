## Code Challenge:  Class 05 - Linked List Implementation
# Singly Linked List
This activity will set up our first linked list and we will work on testing the process of inserting nodes and printing out all of the values

## Challenge
This activity will set up our first linked list and we will work on testing the process of inserting nodes and printing out all of the values

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to set up each test and let the program help me create the properties that I needed to be able to develop the tests.

Creating the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)

Inserting a value:
Time:  O(1)
Space:  O(1)

Printing out the values:
Time:  O(1)
Space:  O(1)

## Code Challenge:  Class 06 - Linked List Append, Insert Before, and Insert After
![Class 06 - Linked List Append, Insert Belore, Insert After](./DataStructures/AppendBeforeAfter.jpg)
# Singly Linked List
We will be updating the linked list that we created in Lab 05

## Challenge
This activity will take the original linked list and create a process for appending it, inserting a node after a specific value, and inserting a node before a specific value.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to set up each test and let the program help me create the properties that I needed to be able to develop the tests.

As the linked list has be to traversed to find the node after/before which a new node is to be inserted.
Appending the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space: O(n)

Inserting a value before another value:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)

Inserting a value after another value:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)

## Code Challenge:  Class 07 - Linked List k-th Value
![Class 07 - Linked List k-th value](./DataStructures/LinkedListkth.jpg)
# Singly Linked List
We will be updating the linked list that we created in Lab 05

## Challenge
This activity will take the original linked list and create a process for finding the length of the list, looping through it to find thek k-th node, and return the value at that node

## Approach & Efficiency

As the linked list has be to traversed to find the node after/before which a new node is to be inserted.
Appending the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space: O(1)

## Code Challenge:  Class 07 - Linked List k-th Value
![Class 08 - Linked List Zip](./DataStructures/linked-lis-zip.jpg)
# Singly Linked List
We will be updating a linked list

## Challenge
This activity will take the a linked list and alternately insert another linked list's nodes into so that the nodes alternate between the values of each linked list in the first list.

## Approach & Efficiency



Zipping the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space: O(n)

## Code Challenge:  Class 10 - Stack and Queue

We will be creating a stack and a queue.

## Challenge
We need to create a stack and pop, push, isempty, peek, and test all.   Same with queue for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and empty and test all.

## Approach & Efficiency

Dealing with a stack:
Time:  O(n)
Space: O(n)

Dealing with a queue:
Time:  O(n)
Space: O(n)

## Code Challenge:  Class 16 - Tree Max
![Class 16 - Tree Max](./DataStructures/Trees/tree-max.jpg)

Using a binary tree, we should find the max value located in the tree.

## Challenge
We need to create a method to traverse the tree nodes and determine which node value is the highest.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time:  O(n)
Space: O(n)

## Code Challenge:  Class 30 - Hash Table Testing

Using the systems hash table features, test by adding, etc.

## Challenge
Create tests only to test the system

## Approach & Efficiency

Time:  O(n)
Space: O(1) - for searches
Space: O(n) - for adding
