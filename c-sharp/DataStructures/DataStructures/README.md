## Code Challenge:  Class 05 - Linked List Implementation
# Singly Linked List
This activity will set up our first linked list and we will work on testing the process of inserting nodes and printing out all of the values

## Challenge
This activity will set up our first linked list and we will work on testing the process of inserting nodes and printing out all of the values

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to set up each test and let the program help me create the properties that I needed to be able to develop the tests.

Creating the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)

Inserting a value:
Time:  O(1)
Space:  O(1)

Printing out the values:
Time:  O(1)
Space:  O(1)

## Code Challenge:  Class 06 - Linked List Append, Insert Before, and Insert After
# Singly Linked List
We will be updating the linked list that we created in Lab 05

## Challenge
This activity will take the original linked list and create a process for appending it, inserting a node after a specific value, and inserting a node before a specific value.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to set up each test and let the program help me create the properties that I needed to be able to develop the tests.

As the linked list has be to traversed to find the node after/before which a new node is to be inserted.
Appending the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space: O(n)

Inserting a value before another value:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)

Inserting a value after another value:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)
