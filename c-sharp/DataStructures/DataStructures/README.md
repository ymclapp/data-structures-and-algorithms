## Code Challenge:  Class 05 - Linked List Implementation
# Singly Linked List
This activity will set up our first linked list and we will work on testing the process of inserting nodes and printing out all of the values

## Challenge
This activity will set up our first linked list and we will work on testing the process of inserting nodes and printing out all of the values

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to set up each test and let the program help me create the properties that I needed to be able to develop the tests.

Creating the linked list:
Time:  O(n)
Space:  O(n)

Inserting a value:
Time:  O(1)
Space:  O(1)

Printing out the values:
Time:  O(1)
Space:  O(1)
