## Code Challenge:  Class 26 - Insertion Sort

## Challenge
Given a set of pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Efficiency

Time:  O(n^2)
Space:  O(1)

## Code Challenge:  Class 27 - Merge Sort

## Challenge
Given a set of pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Efficiency

Time:  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î¸(n)
Space:  O(n)

## Code Challenge:  Class 28 - Quick Sort

## Challenge
Given a set of pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Efficiency

Time:   T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + \theta(n)
Space:  O(Log n)
